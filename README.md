## Installation

### Quick Install (macOS)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/created-by-varun/gyst/master/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release for your architecture from the [releases page](https://github.com/created-by-varun/gyst/releases)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x gyst-darwin-$(uname -m)`
3. Move it to your PATH: `sudo mv gyst-darwin-$(uname -m) /usr/local/bin/gyst`

### Updating

To update gyst to the latest version, you can use either method:

1. Using the install script (recommended):

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/created-by-varun/gyst/master/install.sh | bash
   ```

   The script will automatically detect and replace any existing installation.

2. Manual update:

   ```bash
   # Remove existing installation
   sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/gyst

   # Download and install the latest version
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/created-by-varun/gyst/master/install.sh | bash
   ```

To check your current version:

```bash
gyst --version
```

## Configuration

### Server Mode vs. Direct API Mode

Gyst operates in two modes:

1. **Server Mode (Default)**: Uses our cloud service at `https://gyst-cli.vercel.app` to handle AI operations

   - No API key required
   - Faster response times
   - Always up-to-date with the latest models

2. **Direct API Mode**: Connects directly to the Anthropic API
   - Requires your own API key
   - Useful in environments with restricted internet access
   - Gives you control over model selection

By default, Gyst uses Server Mode for the best user experience. You can switch modes using the configuration command:

```bash
# Enable server mode (default)
gyst config --use-server true

# Switch to direct API mode
gyst config --use-server false
```

### Setting Up API Key (Only for Direct API Mode)

If you've disabled server mode, you'll need to set up your AI provider API key:

```bash
gyst config --api-key your-api-key-here
```

The configuration is stored in `~/.gyst/config.toml`:

```toml
[ai]
provider = "anthropic"  # AI provider (currently supports Anthropic)
api_key = "your-api-key" # API key (required only in direct API mode)
model = "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"  # Model to use

[git]
max_diff_size = 1000  # Maximum diff size in lines

[commit]
max_subject_length = 72  # Maximum length of commit subject line

[server]
use_server = true  # Whether to use server mode (default: true)
```

## Commands

### Generate and Create Commit

```bash
gyst commit [options]
# or use the shorthand
gyst c [options]
```

Analyzes staged changes and generates a commit message using AI.

**Options:**

- `-q, --quick`: Skip confirmation and use the generated message directly
- `-p, --push`: Push changes to the remote repository after committing
- Default behavior: Shows the message and prompts for:
  - `Y` (default): Accept and use the message
  - `n`: Reject and abort commit
  - `e`: Open in editor to modify message

**Example:**

```bash
# Interactive mode (using full command)
gyst commit

# Interactive mode (using shorthand)
gyst c

# Quick mode
gyst commit -q
# or
gyst c -q

# Commit and push
gyst commit -p

# Quick commit and push
gyst commit -q -p
# or
gyst c -qp
```

### Get Multiple Suggestions

```bash
gyst suggest
```

Generates three commit message suggestions for you to choose from. If there are no staged changes, it will offer to stage all changes first.

**Example:**

```bash
# Get 3 suggestions
gyst suggest
```

### Get Git Command Suggestions

```bash
gyst explain "your description here"
```

Get AI-powered suggestions for Git commands based on natural language descriptions of what you want to do.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Find out how to undo the last commit
gyst explain "how do I undo my last commit"

# Learn how to create and switch to a new branch
gyst explain "create and switch to a new branch"

# Get help with resolving merge conflicts
gyst explain "how to resolve merge conflicts"
```

### Branch Health Analysis

```bash
gyst branch health [options]
```

Analyze and report the health status of git branches in your repository. Helps identify stale branches, track activity, and manage branch maintenance.

**Options:**

- `--all`: Include all branches (local and remote)
- `--remote`: Only analyze remote branches
- `--local`: Only analyze local branches (default)
- `--days <number>`: Consider activity within last N days
- `--author <n>`: Filter branches by author
- `--format <format>`: Output format (text, json, markdown)

**Examples:**

```bash
# View health of local branches
gyst branch health

# Include remote branches
gyst branch health --all

# Filter by age (30 days)
gyst branch health --days 30

# Filter by author
gyst branch health --author "John Doe"

# Output in markdown format
gyst branch health --format markdown
```

The command analyzes and reports:

- Branch age and creation date
- Last activity time
- Commit frequency and count
- Author information
- Distance from main branch (commits ahead/behind)
- Overall health status:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Healthy: Recent activity
  - ðŸŸ¡ Needs Attention: Inactive for a while
  - ðŸ”´ Stale: No activity for extended period

### Configure Settings

```bash
gyst config [options]
```

Manage Gyst configuration settings.

**Options:**

- `--api-key <key>`: Set the AI service API key (for direct API mode)
- `--use-server <bool>`: Enable or disable server mode (true/false)
- `-s, --show`: Show current configuration (both forms work)

**Example:**

```bash
# Set API key (for direct API mode)
gyst config --api-key your-api-key-here

# Enable server mode (default)
gyst config --use-server true

# Disable server mode and use direct API
gyst config --use-server false

# View current config
gyst config --show
```

### View Diff

```bash
gyst diff
```

Shows a detailed analysis of staged changes including:

- Added files
- Modified files
- Deleted files
- Renamed files
- Change statistics

## Best Practices

1. **Stage Changes**: Always stage your changes using `git add` before using Gyst commands
2. **Review Messages**: While quick mode is convenient, it's recommended to review the AI-generated messages
3. **Server Mode**: Use the default server mode for the best experience without requiring an API key
4. **API Key**: Only set up your API key if you've disabled server mode
5. **Conventional Commits**: Gyst follows the conventional commit format:
   - Format: `type(scope): description`
   - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, ci, build
